# CodSoft AI Projects

## Description
This repository contains **5 AI projects implemented in Python**, designed for learning and demonstration purposes.  
Each project demonstrates a different AI technique, including **recommendation systems, image captioning, AI game agents, chatbots, and face detection**.

## Projects Included
1. **Movie Recommendation System**  
   - A content-based system that recommends movies based on **genre** and **language**.  
   - Perfect matches (both genre and language) are prioritized, followed by partial matches.

2. **Image Captioning**  
   - Generates textual captions for images using **pre-trained deep learning models**.  
   - Demonstrates the integration of **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing**.

3. **Tic-Tac-Toe AI**  
   - Implements an AI agent for playing Tic-Tac-Toe using the **Minimax algorithm**.  
   - Shows **decision-making algorithms** and **game AI logic**.

4. **Rule-Based Chatbot**  
   - A chatbot that responds to user queries based on **predefined rules** and pattern matching.  
   - Demonstrates **natural language processing** and **conversation flow**.

5. **Face Detection & Recognition**  
   - Detects faces in images and recognizes them using **OpenCV** and **pre-trained models**.  
   - Demonstrates **Computer Vision techniques**, **image processing**, and **face recognition algorithms**.

## How to Use
- Each project has its own Python script(s).  
- Run the Python scripts using:  
```bash
python filename.py
